				<p>Xpozure brings this inspiring entertaining expression to the masses, whilst generating opportunities for young people and helps many others to discover and develop their talents.</p>
				<p>Xpozure was set up by Mr. Skerrett to provide a platform that allows children, teenagers &amp; adultâ€™s dancers to perform in the forefront rather than in the background. This platform was to also provide young people the opportunity to display their talents that revolved around their current interest in music and dance style, whilst entertaining a live audience.</p>
				<p>Dance has become a family social class out, apart from dazzling the audience into disbelieve with outstanding combinations of dance moves, aerial acrobatics and exceptional choreography.</p>
